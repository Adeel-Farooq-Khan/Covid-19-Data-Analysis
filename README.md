Tableau-based Visualization Depicting Global COVID-19 Cases
I'm excited to share my first Tableau project, an interactive visualization of global COVID-19 cases. For this project, I analyzed a dataset of COVID-19 cases from around the world, using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns. I then used Tableau to create a set of visually engaging and informative visualizations that help viewers understand the spread and impact of the pandemic.
My dashboard includes the following visualizations:

A global map showing the total number of confirmed cases in each country, with tooltips providing more detailed information.
Charts tracking the progression of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries over time, with the ability to filter by country or region.
Charts comparing the COVID-19 metrics for different countries or regions, allowing easy identification of hotspots and trends.
A chart showing the daily change in COVID-19 cases for each country, highlighting areas where the virus is spreading rapidly or slowing down.
